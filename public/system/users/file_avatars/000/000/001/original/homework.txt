I think the most obvious effect of Earthâ€™s rotation is that it imposes a daily or diurnal,rhythm in daylight,air temperature,air humidity and air motion.
All life living on the surface of Earth is affected by this diurnal rhythm.Green plants receive and store solar energy during the day and use some of it at night.Green plants will produce oxygen and  glucose with solar energy and carbon dioxide.This is something called photosynthesis.The photosynthesis is very important because almost all life will need the oxygen to live.Of course, humans need this,too.(Strahler A.H. and Strahler A. ,2002)
